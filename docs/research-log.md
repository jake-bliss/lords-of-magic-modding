# Research Log

## 2026-09-11 — Apple Silicon installation

### Environment

- M4 Max Mac
- macOS 26.5.2
- Porting Kit 6.7.0
- `Steambuild 32/64bit DXVK` Wineskin wrapper
- Steam App ID `404040`

### Installation findings

1. Native macOS Steam correctly showed ownership but would not download the Windows-only game.
2. Windows Steam inside Porting Kit successfully downloaded the complete depot.
3. The initial direct game launch exited during its legacy fullscreen transition.
4. Wine debug logs showed a failed display-mode change and invalid OpenGL framebuffer operation.
5. Installing `cnc-ddraw` and forcing its native `ddraw.dll` enabled a stable windowed launch.
6. `DirectDrawRenderer=gdi` and `UseGLSL=disabled` were retained as older Wine compatibility settings, while `cnc-ddraw` itself uses its OpenGL renderer.
7. Catmull-Rom scaling worked; Lanczos2-sharp was later selected for a crisper image.

### CD-ROM prompt investigation

Attempted fixes and outcomes:

| Attempt | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Start Steam's `LOMLauncher.exe` instead of `lomse.exe` | Did not remove prompt |
| Add `HKLM\Software\Sierra Online\Setup\LOMSE\CDPath` | Did not remove prompt |
| Add a Wine `D:` drive typed as CD-ROM | Did not remove prompt |
| Add CDPath under `HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\...` | **Prompt removed** |

Conclusion: the 32-bit process was reading the redirected registry view. The Steam installation script's logical value was correct, but it was missing from the view visible to `lomse.exe` in this Wine configuration.

### Performance findings

- The native `cnc-ddraw` DLL was observed loaded from the game directory.
- Wine OpenGL and Apple's Metal-backed OpenGL driver were active.
- The process used approximately one CPU core continuously.
- The renderer was capped at 60 FPS; GPU performance was not a bottleneck.

## 2026-09-11 — Native archive and asset layer

### Archive inventory

- **Observed:** a native 64-bit Rust tool opened the five GS5R3 core MPQs read-only through a narrow StormLib wrapper.
- **Observed:** all 9,804 members were readable and content-classified with no probe failures.
- **Observed:** the corpus contains 1,377 IFF `FORM PBM` images, 1,800 IMP sprite binaries paired with 1,800 generated C headers, and 3,098 WAVE members.
- **Observed:** all 1,377 PBMs decode, including a ByteRun1 packet that crosses a scanline boundary.

### IMP format findings

- **Observed:** all 1,800 IMP binaries pass bounded table, palette, frame-reference, and packed-pixel decoding, including RLE expansion where applicable.
- **Observed:** the format contains 32-byte file headers, animation sequences/cycles/frames, 256-entry BGRA palettes, six-byte padded hotspots, direct duplicate frames, and repeated cycles.
- **Observed:** the custom RLE uses controls below `0x80` for repeated runs and controls at or above `0x80` for literal runs.
- **Inferred:** file-flag bits `0x30` select 8-, 1-, 2-, or 4-bit indexed storage, and sub-byte indices are packed most-significant-bit first.
- **Observed:** generated-header comparison matches 1,784 of 1,798 paired stems exactly. Fourteen bounded metadata disagreements and four orphan names remain explicit validation failures.
- **Unknown:** the remaining disagreements may represent additional frame-sharing rules or differences between generated statistics and runtime structures.

## 2026-09-11 — Community profiles

### 3.02

- Retrieved community 3.02 build 0014.3 from an archived Sierra Help copy.
- Inspected the archive and its included documentation.
- Confirmed that it replaces `gs.mpq` and configuration files, not `lomse.exe`.
- Installed it into a dedicated APFS clone with vanilla backups.
- Launch-tested successfully.

### GS5R3

- Retrieved the original GS5R3 and required PIC5R3 archives from ManTerA's surviving host.
- Verified both as RAR4 archives and inspected their contents.
- Confirmed that the payload is MPQ data, maps, documentation, and simple batch installers—no replacement executable.
- Installed GS5R3 and PIC5R3 into a second dedicated APFS clone.
- Copied all twelve supplied custom maps into the game's `map/` directory.
- Launch-tested successfully.

## 2026-09-12 — IMP presentation channels

- **Observed:** native SDL3 presentation produces recognizable 8-bit unit art and stable frame scaling.
- **Observed:** one inspected creature frame uses green palette index 0 for 8,576 background pixels and a separate pure-red index for a 1,651-pixel silhouette beneath the creature.
- **Observed:** an inspected 1-bit aura asset uses bright green and red as its two palette colors, confirming that blindly deleting both colors destroys meaningful mask data.
- **Inferred:** green is a background channel in the inspected frames, while red is a separate shadow, translucency, recoloring, or other compositor input.
- **Implemented:** the viewer defaults to a clean preview while `C` cycles through visible-mask and untouched raw-palette modes. The decoder itself preserves every source index and palette color.
- **Unknown:** the original engine's exact mask blend, origins, hotspot behavior, sequence boundaries, and timing still require controlled comparison.

## Evidence labels for future entries

Use these labels when recording findings:

- **Observed:** reproduced on the local machine or directly inspected in a file.
- **Documented:** stated in original or community documentation.
- **Inferred:** strongly suggested by evidence but not yet directly proven.
- **Unknown:** an open question requiring research or experiment.
